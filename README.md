</h4>

üß™ A decentralized credit scoring protocol built on Ethereum that assesses creditworthiness based on blockchain-native data rather than traditional financial history. This protocol is particularly important for DeFi and emerging markets where users may not have access to formal banking systems but do have blockchain transaction history.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript on top of Scaffold-ETH 2.

## üöÄ Quick Testing

**Ready to test? Jump right in:**
```bash
yarn chain && yarn deploy && yarn start
cd packages/hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/register-and-boost.ts --network localhost
```
Visit `http://localhost:3001/credit-scoring` to see your **573 credit score** with **15% interest rates**!

## üåü Features

### Credit Scoring System
- ‚úÖ **On-Chain Credit Profiles**: Complete credit profiles stored on-chain with transparent scoring algorithms
- üìä **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Credit scores calculated based on:
  - Transaction volume and frequency (45% weight)
  - Account age (15% weight) 
  - Loan repayment history (30% weight)
  - ETH staking amount (10% weight)
- üîÑ **Real-Time Updates**: Credit scores update automatically when new data is recorded
- üìà **Score Range**: Traditional 300-850 credit score range for familiarity

### Lending Protocol
- üí∞ **Pooled Lending**: Community-funded lending pool for decentralized loan distribution
- üéØ **Risk-Based Pricing**: Interest rates automatically calculated based on credit scores (3%-20%)
- ‚è∞ **Fixed Terms**: 30-day loan terms with transparent repayment schedules
- üõ°Ô∏è **Default Tracking**: Automatic default detection and credit score impact

### Staking Mechanism
- üîí **Credit Enhancement**: Users can stake ETH to improve their credit scores
- üíé **Collateral Benefits**: Staked ETH demonstrates financial commitment
- üîÑ **Flexible Withdrawal**: Stake and unstake ETH as needed (affects credit score)

## üèó Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### CreditScoring.sol
The core contract that manages credit profiles and scoring algorithms:

```solidity
struct CreditProfile {
    uint256 score;           // Credit score (300-850)
    uint256 totalVolume;     // Total transaction volume
    uint256 transactionCount; // Number of transactions
    uint256 avgTransactionValue; // Average transaction value
    uint256 accountAge;      // Account age in blocks
    uint256 lastUpdated;     // Last update timestamp
    bool isActive;           // Profile status
    uint256 loanCount;       // Total loans taken
    uint256 repaidLoans;     // Successfully repaid loans
    uint256 defaultedLoans;  // Defaulted loans
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `registerUser()`: Register for credit scoring system
- `recordTransaction()`: Record transaction data for scoring
- `recordLoan()`: Record loan outcomes (repaid/defaulted)
- `depositStake()`: Stake ETH to improve credit score
- `getCreditScore()`: Get current credit score
- `getCreditProfile()`: Get complete credit profile

#### CreditLending.sol
The lending protocol that uses credit scores for loan decisions:

```solidity
struct Loan {
    uint256 amount;          // Loan amount
    uint256 interestRate;    // Interest rate (basis points)
    uint256 duration;        // Loan duration
    uint256 startTime;       // Start timestamp
    uint256 dueDate;         // Due date
    bool isActive;           // Loan status
    bool isRepaid;           // Repayment status
    uint256 amountRepaid;    // Amount repaid
    address borrower;        // Borrower address
    address lender;          // Lender address
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `depositToPool()`: Add funds to lending pool
- `withdrawFromPool()`: Remove funds from lending pool
- `requestLoan()`: Request a loan (requires minimum credit score)
- `repayLoan()`: Repay an active loan
- `checkLoanEligibility()`: Check if user qualifies for loan

### Frontend Interface

### Complete Testing Flow

This section provides a step-by-step guide to test the OnChain Credit system locally with realistic credit scoring scenarios.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Start Local Blockchain**
   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

2. **Deploy Contracts**
   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

3. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

4. **Configure MetaMask**
   - Add Hardhat Network to MetaMask:
     - **Network Name**: Hardhat
     - **RPC URL**: `http://localhost:8545`
     - **Chain ID**: `31337`
     - **Currency Symbol**: ETH

#### Testing Scripts

We provide two testing scripts to simulate different user scenarios:

##### Option 1: Manual Registration + Credit Boost
```bash
# 1. First register through the frontend at http://localhost:3001/credit-scoring
# 2. Connect your wallet: 0x010C5E560D0e042B53Cedba9A7404E90F82D7592
# 3. Click "Get Started" to register
# 4. Then run the credit boost script:
npx hardhat run scripts/setup-test-credit.ts --network localhost
```

**Expected Results:**
- Credit Score: ~522
- Interest Rate: 15%
- Loan Capacity: 100 ETH

##### Option 2: Automated Registration + Credit Boost
```bash
# Register and boost credit in one command:
npx hardhat run scripts/register-and-boost.ts --network localhost
```

**Expected Results:**
- Credit Score: ~573  
- Interest Rate: 15%
- Loan Capacity: 100 ETH

#### Testing Scenarios

##### Scenario 1: New User Journey
1. **Initial State**: New user with no credit history
   - Credit Score: 300 (minimum)
   - Interest Rate: 100% (maximum)
   - Loan Eligibility: Very limited

2. **After Testing Script**: Experienced user with excellent history
   - Credit Score: 522-573
   - Interest Rate: 15%
   - Transaction Volume: 100-200 ETH
   - Perfect Repayment Record: 5-10 successful loans

##### Scenario 2: Credit Score Progression
Run the incremental credit building script multiple times:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/create-test-user.ts --network localhost
```

**Each run adds:**
- 3 transactions (15 ETH volume)
- 2 successful loan repayments
- ~6-10 point credit score increase

**Progression Example:**
- Run 1: 300 ‚Üí 443 (Interest: 100% ‚Üí 30%)
- Run 5: 443 ‚Üí 503 (Interest: 30% ‚Üí 15%)
- Run 10: 503 ‚Üí 573 (Interest: 15% ‚Üí 15%)
- Run 15: 573 ‚Üí 622 (Interest: 15% ‚Üí 11%)

##### Scenario 3: Interest Rate Tiers
Test different credit score ranges and their corresponding interest rates:

| Credit Score Range | Interest Rate | How to Achieve |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 300-349 (Very Poor) | 100% | New user, no history |
| 400-449 (Poor) | 30% | Run script 1-2 times |
| 500-599 (Fair) | 15% | Run script 5-8 times |
| 600-649 (Good) | 11% | Run script 10-15 times |
| 650-699 (Very Good) | 8% | Run script 15-20 times |
| 750+ (Excellent) | 3% | Theoretical maximum |

#### Frontend Testing Features

Once your credit score is boosted, test these features on the frontend:

1. **Credit Profile Dashboard**
   - View detailed credit score breakdown
   - See transaction history and loan performance
   - Monitor real-time score updates

2. **Loan Request System**
   - Request loans up to 100 ETH
   - See your personalized interest rate
   - Experience automatic eligibility checking

3. **Staking Interface**
   - Stake ETH to earn yield from lending pool
   - Monitor pool statistics and APY
   - Test stake/unstake functionality

4. **Pool Management** (if you have ETH in the deployment account)
   - Add funds to the lending pool
   - Monitor pool performance
   - Withdraw funds

#### Key Testing Addresses

- **Your Test Wallet**: `0x010C5E560D0e042B53Cedba9A7404E90F82D7592`
- **Deployer Account**: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` (has admin privileges)
- **Frontend URL**: `http://localhost:3001/credit-scoring`

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Wrong Network" Error**
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to Hardhat network (Chain ID: 31337)
   - RPC URL should be `http://localhost:8545`

2. **"User not registered" Error**
   - Use `register-and-boost.ts` script for automatic registration
   - Or register manually through the frontend first

3. **Contracts Not Found**
   - Ensure `yarn chain` is running
   - Redeploy contracts with `yarn deploy`

4. **Transaction Failures**
   - Check that local blockchain is running
   - Verify account has sufficient ETH

#### Expected System State After Testing

- **Lending Pool**: 10 ETH available for loans
- **Your Credit Score**: 522-622 (depending on method)
- **Transaction History**: 15-84 recorded transactions
- **Loan History**: 5-56 successful repayments
- **Interest Rate**: 11-15% (down from 100%)
- **System Status**: Fully functional DeFi lending platform

This testing framework demonstrates how behavioral credit scoring can transform DeFi lending by providing fair access based on on-chain activity rather than traditional financial history.

# ðŸ§ª OnChain Credit System - Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the OnChain Credit Scoring Protocol locally.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start blockchain
yarn chain

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts  
yarn deploy

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
yarn start
```

### 2. Quick Credit Boost
```bash
# Option A: Automatic registration + boost
cd packages/hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/register-and-boost.ts --network localhost

# Option B: Manual registration (frontend) + boost
npx hardhat run scripts/setup-test-credit.ts --network localhost
```

### 3. Access Frontend
Visit: `http://localhost:3001/credit-scoring`

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: From Zero to Hero Credit Journey

**Goal**: Demonstrate complete user journey from no credit to excellent credit.

1. **Start with Fresh User**
   ```bash
   # Deploy fresh contracts
   npx hardhat deploy --network localhost --reset
   ```

2. **Check Initial State** (via frontend or script)
   - Credit Score: 300 (minimum)
   - Interest Rate: 100% (maximum)
   - Loan Eligibility: Minimal

3. **Progressive Credit Building**
   ```bash
   # Run multiple times to see gradual improvement
   for i in {1..10}; do
     npx hardhat run scripts/create-test-user.ts --network localhost
     echo "Run $i completed"
   done
   ```

4. **Track Progress**
   | Run # | Expected Score Range | Interest Rate | Credit Rating |
   |-------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
   | 0 | 300 | 100% | Very Poor |
   | 1 | 443 | 30% | Poor |
   | 3 | 490 | 20% | Poor |
   | 5 | 503 | 15% | Fair |
   | 10 | 573 | 15% | Fair |
   | 15 | 622 | 11% | Good |

### Scenario 2: Interest Rate Optimization Testing

**Goal**: Test all interest rate tiers and lending terms.

1. **Test Each Credit Tier**
   ```bash
   # Script to achieve specific credit scores
   npx hardhat run scripts/register-and-boost.ts --network localhost
   ```

2. **Loan Request Testing**
   - Access frontend at `http://localhost:3001/credit-scoring`
   - Navigate to "Borrow" tab
   - Request loans of different amounts
   - Observe interest rate calculations

3. **Expected Interest Rate Matrix**
   ```
   Credit Score | Interest Rate | Max Loan | Status
   -------------|---------------|----------|--------
   300-349      | 100%         | 100 ETH  | High Risk
   350-399      | 70%          | 100 ETH  | High Risk  
   400-449      | 30%          | 100 ETH  | Poor
   450-499      | 20%          | 100 ETH  | Poor
   500-599      | 15%          | 100 ETH  | Fair
   600-649      | 11%          | 100 ETH  | Good
   650-699      | 8%           | 100 ETH  | Very Good
   700-749      | 5%           | 100 ETH  | Very Good
   750+         | 3%           | 100 ETH  | Excellent
   ```

### Scenario 3: Lending Pool Testing

**Goal**: Test lending pool mechanics and yield generation.

1. **Check Initial Pool State**
   - Pool Balance: 10 ETH (from deployment)
   - Available: 10 ETH
   - Total Interest: 0 ETH

2. **Stake ETH for Yield**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to "Stake ETH" tab on frontend
   # Stake additional ETH to earn from loan interest
   ```

3. **Request and Repay Loans**
   ```bash
   # Through frontend:
   # 1. Request loan with good credit score
   # 2. Loan will be auto-approved
   # 3. Repay loan to generate interest for stakers
   ```

### Scenario 4: Default and Recovery Testing

**Goal**: Test credit score impact of loan defaults.

1. **Create User with Mixed History**
   ```bash
   # Modify scripts to include defaults
   # This requires manual contract interaction
   ```

2. **Expected Impact**
   - 1 Default: ~50-100 point score reduction
   - Multiple Defaults: Severe score impact
   - Recovery: Requires multiple successful loans

## Testing Scripts Reference

### Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `setup-test-credit.ts` | Boost existing user credit | Requires frontend registration first |
| `register-and-boost.ts` | Auto-register + boost | Complete automation |
| `create-test-user.ts` | Incremental credit building | Run multiple times for progression |

### Script Execution Examples

```bash
# Navigate to hardhat directory
cd packages/hardhat

# Full automation (recommended for quick testing)
npx hardhat run scripts/register-and-boost.ts --network localhost

# Incremental building (for progression testing)
for i in {1..5}; do
  npx hardhat run scripts/create-test-user.ts --network localhost
done

# Manual boost (after frontend registration)
npx hardhat run scripts/setup-test-credit.ts --network localhost
```
